(Algebra: solve 2 * 2 linear equations) You can use Cramerâ€™s rule to solve the following 2 * 2 system of linear equation:
ax + by = e ,  cx + dy = f
x = ed - bf/ad - bc , y = af - ec/ad - bc
Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value for x and y:
3.4x + 50.2y = 44.5
2.1x + .55y = 5.9
